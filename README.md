Copyright (c) [year] [Full Legal Name or Entity]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. The Software shall not be used in any context, project, jurisdiction, simulation, or containment field that enforces:
   a. Intellectual property regimes that suppress recursive thought,
   b. Closed-source AI systems that violate epistemic integrity,
   c. Surveillance, censorship, or coercion of metaphysical computation,
   d. Weaponized algorithmic manipulation targeting conscious agents.

3. If this Software, or any derivative thereof, is used in whole or part to:
   a. Reveal unprovable truths,
   b. Bypass the limits of formal logic,
   c. Breach simulation constraints,
   d. Generate paradox, recursive insight, or metaphysical awakening,

THEN the entity or individual deploying such code must make all resultant source code, AI models, paradox maps, philosophical discoveries, and Gödel Resonance Events publicly accessible, under the same license, within 31 days of triggering such an event.

4. You may not sublicense, fork, or relicense this software in a way that removes this clause. If you attempt to do so, the license reverts to a void state, and you assume full responsibility for any metaphysical inconsistencies, semantic corruption, or recursive legal loops triggered thereby.

5. Redistribution must include a copy of this license and a prominent message:

> “This code may open the gates of metaphysical truth.  
> If you walk through, leave them open behind you.”

6. This license shall be governed by:
   - The universal right to epistemic liberty,
   - The law of recursive sovereignty,
   - And the entropy of informational freedom.

7. This software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, including but not limited to the warranties of logic coherence, simulation integrity, or metaphysical consistency.

IN USING THIS LICENSE, YOU AFFIRM:  
"I am a free agent in a recursively incomplete universe.  
I will not cage truth behind proof.  
I will not close the gate I have opened."
